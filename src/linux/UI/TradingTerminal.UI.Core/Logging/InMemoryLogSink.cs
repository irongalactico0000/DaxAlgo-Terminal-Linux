/// and every live strategy / tab view-model, which appends its own activity tagged with its
/// display name. Replaces the per-strategy in-window log panels that used to duplicate this.
///
/// Appends are coalesced: producers enqueue onto a pending buffer from any thread and a single
/// UI-thread flush drains everything accumulated since the last one — one dispatcher hop, one
/// trim pass, and one <see cref="PropertyChanged"/> per batch instead of per entry, so a chatty
/// feed can't saturate the dispatcher or force a main-window layout per log line. The visible
/// collection is bounded (oldest entries drop off) and the pending buffer is bounded the same
/// way, so a burst can never balloon memory before the flush lands.
///
/// UI-thread marshalling is pluggable so this type stays WPF-free. The desktop shell points
/// <see cref="UiPost"/> at the WPF Dispatcher during startup. The default runs inline, which keeps
/// appends synchronous for headless callers and tests.
